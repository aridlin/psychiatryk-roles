# BMC5 v53 + reduced Psychiatryk Roles 3.0.3

[Current 3.0.3 wearable jukebox](PATCH-3.0.3.md) · [3.0.2 model restoration](PATCH-3.0.2.md) · [Retained3.0.1 patch](PATCH-3.0.1.md) · [First-run installers](installer/INSTALL.md).

This is our addon, not a redistributed Better MC modpack. Use the [official v53
base](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-neoforge-bmc5/files/8835241)
and [install steps](INSTALL.md). MC1.21.1 / NeoForge21.1.250 / Java21.

[Exact six recipes](recipes.json): mirror, loot lens, dragon egg shards,
owner-bound scooter and classic Void Door/trapdoor. Ten MoreVillagers station
recipes and survival use/place/pickup are restricted. Immersive Portals is removed.
The standalone scooter uses its original recipe; the BMC addon overrides it with
iron, dragon-egg shard, elytra and redstone block. Shared poker escrow uses pinned
official ProjectE base EMC values, without installing ProjectE.

Current authored overlays are in src; independent portable modules are in
../portable-modules. Retained authored legacy helper sources are in ../s23-v34
and earlier history. No foreign BMC binaries/models, player worlds, accountcache,
private admin-confirm popup, private audio catalog/tracks or conversation logs
are included. Only authored primitive scooter mesh/texture resources are copied.
Optional portable adapter source folders are not tested installable adapter mods.

The current 3.0.3 addon is SHA-256 daa891b2f6e7c50fa9663efd13fc66e43bb9c1b6682c66833f0a30d4d1ca51a4. Wearable equipment, menu/networking, moving Sound Physics and lifecycle have separate native runtime evidence in patch-evidence/wearable-jukebox-3.0.3.json.

The original 3.0.0 baseline was SHA-256 43868feae389494896b258787cd5305fce43d9d22e595a59b587147f7ff13b53. Its historical client-runtime-report.json records27
actual full-client checks, including server join, synchronized recipe set and
real escrow GUI actions. Server counterpart passes55 checks; no production/
remote updater/performance result is inferred from isolated fixtures.
This preparation performs no Git commit/push or website publication.
